and credentials will be stored locally on the computer you run the program with. 
In the web service, we store the hosts and credentials in a database on our

efforts, we are not cyber security experts and cannot guarantee the program is 
100% bug-free.

Please do not use the program on a public computer. 
We are not responsible for any unintended use of our program, including but not 
limited to Academic Misconduct, loss of data when the APIs are called with 
unofficial web clients, and any hacking behaviour that utilises our tool. 
However, if you suspect there is any security vulnerability, you are more than 
welcome to email support@ictrl.ca , and we will try our best to address such 
issues.`;
